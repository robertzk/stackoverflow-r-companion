#' StackOverflow R Companion provides alerts from within the interactive R
#' console whenever a new R question is posted. Since useRs tend to spend a lot of time
#' in the console, by embedding the read-answer flow into the console it should greatly
#' increase the speed at which questions can be answered -- which leads to more of that
#' juicy karma!
