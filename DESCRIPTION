Title: Read and answer Stackoverflow posts from the comfort of the R
    interactive console
Description: StackOverflow R Companion provides alerts from within the
    interactive R console whenever a new R question is posted. Since useRs tend
    to spend a lot of time in the console, by embedding the read-answer flow
    into the console it should greatly increase the speed at which questions
    can be answered -- which leads to more of that juicy karma!
